# Contributing

This document is for everyone working on `golib` — humans and AI agents alike.
It covers the layout, the local dev loop, the conventions that bite, and how a
change gets from an issue to a release.

## Where to find things

Deep-link by filename; line numbers will drift.

## Module layout

Three packages, stable/alpha versioning:

```
github.com/cnuss/golib           — root façade. Stable surface (New).
github.com/cnuss/golib/v1        — stable Builder[T] interface + Result[T].
github.com/cnuss/golib/v1alpha1  — current implementation. May change
                                   between alpha revisions.
```

Application code imports the root (`golib.New[T]()…`). Code that needs to
declare types against the interface imports `v1`. Direct access to the
`BuilderImpl[T]` struct lives in `v1alpha1`. The current `Builder[T]` API is a
generic starting point — swap it for the real one, keeping the layering.

## Local development

Requires Go 1.21 or later.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/cnuss/golib.git
cd golib
make test   # library unit + fuzz tests (fast, in-package)
make e2e    # builds and runs every example binary
```

Run a specific example locally:

```sh
make run basic
make run named
```

## Before you push

- `gofmt -w .`
- `go vet ./...`
- `make test`
- `make e2e`

CI runs the same on every PR.

## Conventions that bite

Easy to get wrong from the diff alone:

- **`examples/` is intentionally duplicated.** Each `main.go` is a
  copy-pasteable starter; no shared internal package. Don't refactor it into
  one.
- **godoc example funcs can't bind to generic types.** `go vet` rejects
  `ExampleBuilder_*` in `v1` because `Builder` is parameterized — its example
  checker hasn't caught up with generics. Work around it with package-level
  example names (`Example_value` etc.). See [`v1/example_test.go`](./v1/example_test.go).
- **e2e builds binaries at runtime**, so the test cache can't see example
  source changes — `make e2e` passes `-count=1` to force a rebuild.
- **Skip-release token must be line-anchored.** The regex in
  [`ci.yml`](./.github/workflows/ci.yml) (`resolve tag` step) is
  `^[[:space:]]*\[skip release\][[:space:]]*$`. Inline prose mentions are safe;
  a standalone line in the commit body opts out.
- **Cosign / Scorecard tags are annotated.** `ossf/scorecard-action` publishes
  annotated tags; pinning the tag-object SHA fails Sigstore verification
  ("imposter commit"). Pin to the commit underneath (see existing entries in
  [`scorecard.yml`](./.github/workflows/scorecard.yml)).

## Adding an example

Examples live in `./examples/<name>/main.go`. Keep each example self-contained
(there's no shared internal package — the duplication is intentional, so each
example is copy-pasteable on its own).

Print a single recognizable line so the e2e harness can assert on it, then add
a row to the `cases` table in `e2e/e2e_test.go` (name + expected substring) and
to the README's example table.

## Branch / PR flow

**Every change starts with an issue** — no exceptions, including retroactive
cleanups. The PR body always carries a `Closes #<n>` line so the merge
auto-closes the tracking issue and leaves a paper trail.

```sh
gh issue create --title "…" --body "…"                    # 1. issue first
git switch -c <type>/<topic>                              # 2. branch
# ... edits, commit ...
git push -u origin <type>/<topic>
gh pr create --title "<type>: …" --body "Closes #<n>. …"  # 3. PR refs the issue
# CI green ⇒
gh pr merge <pr#> --squash --delete-branch
```

`main` is protected (`ci` required; no force-push). Don't push directly to it
for routine work — PR flow gives CI + auto-release a clean audit trail. Pushing
to `main` auto-bumps a patch tag and signs the release (see Releasing below).

Don't commit secrets. [`.gitignore`](./.gitignore) covers `.env*`, `.claude/`,
etc.

## Pull requests

- Keep PRs focused. One feature or fix per PR.
- Include test coverage for behavior changes — lib tests (`v1alpha1/`) for API
  changes, e2e tests (`e2e/e2e_test.go`) for example-visible changes.
- **Keep the README in sync with the façade.** The README mirrors the public
  surface, so any change to it must update the README in the same PR:
  - a new/changed/removed method on `Builder[T]` (or the `v1` surface) → update
    the **API at a glance** block and the **Quick Start** snippet;
  - a new example → add a row to the **Examples** table;
  - a renamed package/version tier → update the **Layout** tree.
  Treat the README's code blocks as documentation that must compile against the
  current API — stale snippets are a review blocker.
- Signed commits preferred. The repo enables commit signing locally; CI does
  not enforce signatures.

## Commit messages

Short subject (≤ 72 chars), imperative mood ("Add X", not "Added X").
Wrap body at ~72 cols. Explain the *why*; the diff covers the *what*.

## Releasing

Patch releases are automatic. Every push to `main` runs the `Release`
workflow, which bumps the patch component of the latest `v*` tag,
re-runs `go vet`, `go build`, `make test`, and `make e2e` against that
ref, then:

- pushes the new tag,
- creates a GitHub Release with auto-generated notes, and
- warms `proxy.golang.org` so [pkg.go.dev](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/cnuss/golib)
  surfaces the new version without manual prodding.

To opt a commit out of the auto-bump, put `[skip release]` on its own
line in the commit body. (It must be the only thing on its line, so
prose mentioning the token inline doesn't accidentally suppress.)

For a minor or major bump, tag locally and push the tag — the workflow
treats a manual tag as the version of record and skips the bump:

```sh
git tag v0.2.0
git push --tags
```

Tags must follow `vMAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` (Go module semver).
